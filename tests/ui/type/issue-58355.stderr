error[E0277]: expected a `Fn()` closure, found `fn() -> dyn ToString`
  --> $DIR/issue-58355.rs:5:14

LL |     x = Some(Box::new(callback));
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected an `Fn()` closure, found `fn() -> dyn ToString`
   |
   = help: within `fn() -> dyn ToString`, the trait `Fn<()>` is not implemented for `fn() -> dyn ToString`, which is required by `fn() -> dyn ToString: Fn()`
   = note: wrap the `fn() -> dyn ToString` in a closure with no arguments: `|| { /* code */ }`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `fn() -> dyn ToString`
   = note: required for the cast from `Box<fn() -> dyn ToString>` to `Box<dyn Fn() -> (dyn ToString + 'static)>`
