    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `&Dummy` cannot be formatted using `{:?}` because it doesn't implement `Debug`
    |
    = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `&Dummy`, which is required by `&Dummy: Debug`
    = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `dbg` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
